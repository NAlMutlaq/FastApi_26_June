## Build a phone book program that receives the phone number, and returns the name of the owner. 

You can follow the table below:
| Name    | Number      |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Amal     | 0531511811 |
| Mohammed | 0551511231 |
| Khadijah | 0531511113 |
| Abdullah  | 0541511123 |
| Rawan    | 0591511128 |
| Faisal   | 0581521129 |
| Layla    | 0563513453 |


- Ask the user to enter the phone number using input
- If the number exists, print the owner. Otherwise, print "Sorry, the number is not found".
- If the number is less or more than 10 numbers, print "This is invalid number".
- If the number contains letters or symbols, print "This is invalid number".
