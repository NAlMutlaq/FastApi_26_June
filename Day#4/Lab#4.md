## Create a ToDo List API that does the following: 
Your base model should have the Pydantic model(Todo model):
- Task Name
- Task Date
- Task description

## Create the following functions:
- create_task(): it allows you to add tasks to the task list.
- get_all_tasks(): it retrieves all tasks.
- get_task(): it retrieves a task based on a specific id.
- update_task(): it updates a task based on a specific id.
- delete_task(): it deletes a task based on a specific id.

## For Additional Practice :
- Use raise HTTPException with status_code.
